# Argo CD Configs

Contains raw Kubernetes manifests that contain resources
that Argo CD deploys to Kubernetes.

üìù The github.com/adfinis/argocd-configs repository contains
a basic Argo CD sandbox environment that can be started
in a local kind environment easily. If can be used as a
template to start new repos or as a standalone playground.

## Bootstrap

To bootstrap an environment the following steps on the CLI
should get you started.

First you will need a Kubernetes environment. This example
works well with kind:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

If you can't use kind, any other Kubernetes distro that
supports port-forwarding should work as well. e.g. if
you want to isolate the environment in a VM, you might
use minishift:

```bash
minikube start
```

Once you have access to a running Kubernetes, you can
proceed to deploy Argo CD.

```bash
# check you are using the right context
kubectl config current-context

# install with Helm
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm repo update
helm install --create-namespace --namespace infra-argocd argocd argo/argo-cd

# wait for it to deploy and connect
kubectl -n infra-argocd wait pods --selector app.kubernetes.io/instance=argocd --for condition=Ready --timeout=90s
kubectl -n infra-argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
kubectl -n infra-argocd port-forward service/argocd-server 8080:443
```

Once this is done, we can configure Argo CD using `kubectl apply`:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: infra-argocd
  namespace: infra-argocd
spec:
  clusterResourceWhitelist:
  - group: ""
    kind: Namespace
  - group: apiextensions.k8s.io
    kind: CustomResourceDefinition
  - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
  - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
  description: Deploy and manage the hosted Argo CD instance.
  destinations:
  - namespace: infra-argocd
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  sourceRepos:

  - https://charts.adfinis.com
  - https://github.com/adfinis/argocd-configs.git
EOF

kubectl apply -f manifests/dev/infra-apps.yaml
```

After these steps you'll have to restart the port-forward
since Argo CD will have redeployed itself.

```bash
kubectl -n infra-argocd port-forward service/argocd-server 8080:443
```

Reload the page and the following apps should be configured and healthy.

* `infra-apps` (app-of-apps application for managing baseline infrastructure)
* `app-argocd` (application for managing Argo CD deployment)

To ensure that everything we applied with kubectl is managed by Argo CD
going forward, we create a `misc-apps` application that managed the
`app-argocd-apps` application.

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/dev/misc-apps.yaml
```

With this some more apps will show up in the UI:

* `misc-apps` (app-of-apps application for managing several misc apps)
* `app-argocd-apps` (application for managing applications in Argo CD)
* `argocd-configs` (application for the gitops integration of this repository)

Now that you have Argo CD deployed and managed via a git repository you
can start using it. In a typical production environment you could consider
the following next steps:

* Replace wildcarded versions by replacing the `*` in `targetRevision: "*"` with a specific version
* Deploy applications by enabling them in `infra-apps.yaml`, `misc-apps.yaml`, or by adding more YAML
* Configure Argo CD to support SSO
* Harden Argo CD

To deploy applications using the managed Argo CD instance, you'll create
additional `manifests/dev/app-$name.yaml` files. If the application is
available in an Adfinis app-of-apps chart, then the file would be called
`manifests/dev/$name-apps.yaml`.

If you want to get rid of the environment you built, we recommend that you
remove the underlying Kubernetes cluster:

```
# if you are running kind
kind delete cluster

# if you are running in a minikube VM
minikube delete
```
